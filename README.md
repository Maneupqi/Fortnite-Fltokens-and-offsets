# Fortnite Args/Fltokens and Offsets

I may update the offsets each update now instead the args
<br>
The grabber still works so yeah (version 1 or 2 will work fine)
<br><br>
I Do Update This (might take a while bc i dont play much fn)
<br>
I've updated this added chapter 3 and fixed some issues and updated the [README](https://github.com/zinx-YT/Fortnite-Fltokens-and-offsets/blob/main/Fltokens/README.md)
<br>
Make sure its the correct fltoken
